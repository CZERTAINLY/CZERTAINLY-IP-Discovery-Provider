Network Discovery provider implements the logic of discovering certificates that are distributed over the network.

Network Discovery Provider can discover certificates from:
- Intranet - Scan the entire infrastructure inside an organization and discover the certificates from application and 
sites that are not exposed to the outside worked
- Internet - If the provider has access to the internet, It can discover certificates from any publicly accessible URLs

The `Connector` provides various options during the certificate, including:
- Single Host Scan
- Multiple Host Scan
- Single / Multi Subnet Scan
- Single / All port Scan

## Short Process Description

`Connector` discovers the certificates from the host without increasing the network traffic and congestion. When the connector receives the request to scan the host, it tries to connect to the ssl port (which can be left default to `443` or provided with custom value), captures the certificates and parses them. Once the certificates are successfully gathered, it is then sent back to the `Core` for storage and parsing. `Core` takes care of the rest.

To know more about `Core`, refer to [CZERTAINLY Core](https://github.com/CZERTAINLY/CZERTAINLY-Core).

## Interfaces

Network discovery provider implements the `Discovery Provider` Interface from the CZERTAINLY Interfaces. To learn more about the interfaces and end points, refer to the [CZERTAINLY Interfaces](https://github.com/CZERTAINLY/CZERTAINLY-Interfaces).

For more information regarding the `Discovery`, please refer to the [CZERTAINLY documentation](https://docs.czertainly.com).
